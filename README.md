Write some code that, giving an array of string, prints out the number of occurrences where a char is repeated

[“a”,”b”,”c”] -> 0
[“a”,”b”,”cc”] -> 1
[“abc”,”deef”,”hi”, “mnmn”] -> 2

Write some code that will flatten an array of arbitrarily nested arrays of integers into a flat array of integers
example: [[1,2,[3]],4] -> [1,2,3,4]

Write a very simple chat server that should listen on TCP port 10000 for clients. The chat protocol is very simple, clients connect with "telnet" and write single lines of text. On each new line of text, the server will broadcast that line to all other connected clients
